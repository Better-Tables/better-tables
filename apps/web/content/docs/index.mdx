**Better Tables** is a type-safe, database-agnostic table library for React with advanced filtering, sorting, and virtual scrolling. Stop writing boilerplate. Start shipping features.

## The Problem

Building complex data tables shouldn't be a soul-crushing mix of useState hooks, prop drilling, and scattered utility functions. Most table libraries ask you to:

- Wire up filtering logic across multiple files
- Manually handle joins and relationships in your queries
- Write the same filter UI components over and over
- Manually sync URL state for shareable views
- Give up type safety between your database and UI
- Rebuild pagination and sorting logic for every project

## The Solution

Better Tables revolutionizes how you work with relational data:

- **Automatic Relationships**: Filter across joined tables without writing JOIN queries yourself
- **Database Adapters**: Define your schema once—filters automatically work across relationships
- **Type-Safe End-to-End**: From your database query to your UI component, full type inference
- **Zero Boilerplate**: Declarative column definitions give you filtering, sorting, and pagination automatically

## What We're Building

Better Tables is an open-source project actively being developed. The goal is to make building complex data tables in React applications as simple as possible, without sacrificing type safety or performance.

The library is built as a monorepo with clear separation of concerns:

- **@better-tables/core** - Type-safe builders, managers, and utilities
- **@better-tables/ui** - Production-ready React components with shadcn/ui
- **@better-tables/adapters-drizzle** - Automatic relationship detection and JOIN generation
- **@better-tables/cli** - CLI tool for easy project setup

## Current Status

Better Tables is in active development (v0.5). Current features include:

- ✅ Complete filter manager with 6 filter types
- ✅ Drizzle adapter with automatic relationship detection
- ✅ UI components with shadcn/ui
- ✅ Virtual scrolling support
- ✅ URL state persistence
- ✅ Server-side rendering support (Next.js)
- ✅ CLI tool for project initialization
- ✅ Data export (CSV, Excel, JSON) with batch processing

## Get Started

Install the core package and choose an adapter:

<InstallBlock packages={['@better-tables/core', '@better-tables/adapters-drizzle']} />

Or use the CLI to initialize Better Tables in your project:

<InstallBlock packages={['@better-tables/cli']} />

```bash
pnpm dlx @better-tables/cli init
```
